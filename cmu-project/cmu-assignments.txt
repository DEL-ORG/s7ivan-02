complete these exercises.

1. Write a script to replace all the spaces " " with underscores "_" in file names for an entire
directory sub-tree.

2. Write a script to display all the users and a count of the number of processes they each

For a stock ubuntu install connect as temp-user (which has sudo access)
Add the following apt repository to the system: http://aptrepo.srv.cs.cmu.edu
Install the package cmucs-sca-gs
Remove the temp-user from the system then reboot
Modify the above playbook/s to also add the following iP table rules to the
